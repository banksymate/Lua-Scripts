# Pure Base64 Implementations

None of the actual base64 libraries belong to me.

I just did some testing on them and am putting them here for reference purposes. Although, I do feel that I need to create a faster version :/

There are 3 versions that I found on the web and only version 1 could complete the test. (*sobs*)
